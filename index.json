Many of the concepts used in evolutionary biology have been tailored to particular organisms. I am interested in developing those concepts once they have been freed from the specificities of the organisms to which they have classically been applied. For instance, the concepts of fitness and heritability have been used primarily in the context of multicellular organisms, which often reproduce sexually. In several publications, I propose extensions of those concepts to other evolutionary contexts, such as settings where the entities of a population do not reproduce.\n","date":1653825920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653825920,"objectID":"eb17d88facfa5c1ab56e572adde33498","permalink":"https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/conceptualisation/","publishdate":"2022-05-29T22:05:20+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/conceptualisation/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Theory","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Over the last few years, I have been working on multilevel selection and, in collaboration with evolutionary biologists, on the so-called evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs). ETIs are major events in the course of evolution. They include, the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, the transition from the prokaryotic to the eukoryotic cell, and the transition from simple replicators to chromosome-like entities, among others.\nThe problem of whether selection acts at more than one level, such as the level of the gene or the organism, is a central topic in philosophy of biology. A classical response to the debate is to say that levels of selection are a matter of conventions rather than facts. In a recent book, Facts, Conventions, and the Levels of Selection (2021), I tackle this issue and argue that the conventionalist (also known as ‘pluralist’) response is not fully adequate. There is a sense in which it can be said objectively that natural selection acts at one level rather than another other. I develop an account that tracks this sense and can be operationalised and applied in the context of ETIs which have become the focus of the multilevel selection literature in recent years.\nETIs are the topic of two grants I currently hold: a DECRA from the ARC and a grant from the John Templeton Foundation as part of the Agency, Directionality, and Function project hosted by the University of Minnesota.\n","date":1653823489,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653823489,"objectID":"814fe71feb86f4c130f3b01f4baf4c88","permalink":"https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/individuality/","publishdate":"2022-05-29T21:24:49+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/individuality/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Multilevel Selection, Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality \u0026 The Concept of Individuality ","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I have a longlasting interest in cultural evolution and its interplay with biological evolution.

Further, contrary to the case of biological transmission, there is no general convention—to which researchers in this field adhere—for describing cultural transmission at a particular grain.\nPrior to switching to philosophy, I worked on the evolution of religious beliefs.
