      <title>Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One central theme of my research is the conceptual foundation of evolutionary theory. Many of the concepts used in evolutionary biology have been tailored to particular organisms. I am interested in developing those concepts once they have been freed from the specificities of the organisms to which they have classically been applied. For instance, the concepts of fitness and heritability have been  used primarily in the context of multicellular organisms, which often reproduce sexually. In several publications, I propose extensions of those concepts to other evolutionary contexts, such as settings where the entities of a population do not reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multilevel Selection, Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality &amp; The Concept of Individuality </title>
      <link>https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/individuality/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I have been working on multilevel selection and, in collaboration with evolutionary biologists, on the so-called evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs). ETIs are major events in the course of evolution. They include, the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, the transition from the prokaryotic to the eukoryotic cell, and the transition from simple replicators to chromosome-like entities, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of whether selection acts at more than one level, such as the level of the gene or the organism, is a central topic in philosophy of biology. A classical response to the debate is to say that levels of selection are a matter of conventions rather than facts. In a recent book, &lt;em&gt;Facts, Conventions, and the Levels of Selection&lt;/em&gt; (2021), I tackle this issue and argue that the conventionalist (also known as &amp;lsquo;pluralist&amp;rsquo;) response is not fully adequate. There is a sense in which it can be said objectively that natural selection acts at one level rather than another other. I develop an account that tracks this sense and can be operationalised and applied in the context of ETIs which have become the focus of the multilevel selection literature in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETIs are the topic of two grants I currently hold: a DECRA from the ARC and a grant from the John Templeton Foundation as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biologicalpurpose.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Agency, Directionality, and Function&lt;/a&gt; project hosted by the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural Evolution &amp; its Interplay with Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/cultural/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 21:24:10 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/cultural/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a longlasting interest in cultural evolution and its interplay with biological evolution. I recently published several papers on the fidelity of transmission in cultural evolution. Together with Mathieu Charbonneau, I argue that degree of fidelity of transmission is tightly linked to the grain of description used to describe a particular transmission event. Further, contrary to the case of biological transmission, there is no general convention—to which researchers in this field adhere—for describing cultural transmission at a particular grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to switching to philosophy, I worked on the evolution of religious beliefs. The challenge of integrating the different approaches to this phenomenon formed one reason that prompted me to move into philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Causation in Biology</title>
      <link>https://pierrickbourrat.github.io/project/causation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 22:05:20 +1000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Causation is at the heart of any scientific inquiry. I am interested in characterising this phenomenon both generally and more particularly in biological contexts. In particular, I have been interested in the concept of heritability, which is used in several subfields of biology. I have also developed several information theoretic measures of causation within the interventionist account and, more recently, proposed some ways to link information theory and the interventionist account to heritability.&lt;/p&gt;
